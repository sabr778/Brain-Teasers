3.一群逻辑思维缜密且聪明的人开舞会，每人头上都戴着一顶帽子。
帽子只有黑白两种，黑的至少有一顶。
每个人都能看到其它人帽子的颜色，却看不到自己的。
起初灯亮着，主持人先让大家 看看别人头上戴的是什幺帽子，然后关灯，如果有人知道自己帽子的颜色就拍手。
1)第一次关灯，没有声音。
2)那么开灯，大家再看一遍，第二次关灯时仍然 鸦雀无声。
3)那么再开灯，到第三次关灯，才有噼噼啪啪的掌声响起。问有多少人戴着黑帽子？

上面这题有个很有名的类似题，一并贴出。题目是这样的：说一个岛上有100个人，其中有5个红眼睛，95个蓝眼睛。这个岛有三个奇怪的宗教规则。1. 他们不能照镜子，不能看自己眼睛的颜色。2. 他们不能告诉别人对方的眼睛是什么颜色。3. 一旦有人知道了自己的眼睛颜色，他就必须在当天夜里自杀。（尊重博客原题，把原来的“知道自己是红眼睛”改成现在的“知道自己的眼睛颜色”）注：虽然题设了有5个红眼睛，但岛民是不知道具体数字的。某天，有个旅行者到了这个岛上。由于不知道这里的规矩，所以他在和全岛人一起狂欢的时候，不留神就说了一句话：【你们这里有红眼睛的人。】最后的问题是：假设这个岛上的人足够聪明，每个人都可以做出缜密的逻辑推理。请问这个岛上将会发生什么？
